	abstract = {Commercial landings of sardines are known to show strong year-to-year fluctuations. A key driver is thought to be environmental variability, to which small forage fish are especially sensitive. We examined the utility of including environmental covariates in forecasts for landings of the Indian oil sardine using a long-term time series of quarterly catches. Potentially influential variables examined included precipitation, upwelling intensity, sea surface temperature (SST), and chlorophyll-a concentration. All of these have been shown to be important for oil sardine growth and survival, spawning and/or movement into the nearshore fishing regions. However, improving out-of-sample landings forecasts using environmental covariates has often proven elusive. We tested the inclusion of environmental covariates in forecast models using generalized additive models, which allow for non-linear responses, and dynamic linear models, which allow for time-varying responses. Only two environmental covariates improved out-of-sample prediction: the 2.5-year average regional SST and precipitation over land during June–July. The most significant improvement was with the SST covariate and post-monsoon landings with a 19\%–22\% reduction in mean-squared prediction error. Models with the second best covariate, monsoon precipitation over land, provided a 4\%–8\% reduction in prediction error. We also tested large-scale ocean climate teleconnection indices. One, an index of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, also improved out-of-sample predictions similarly to the multiyear average regional SST. The earth's changing climate is associated with both rapid warming in the Western Indian Ocean and changes to monsoon rainfall patterns. Our work highlights these as key variables that can improve forecasting of oil sardine landings.},

	abstract = {The study of monthly mean local temperature anomaly (LTA defined as the difference between coastal and mid-ocean sea surface temperatures), and Ekman transport along the west and east coasts of India based on 60-year data set of Hastenrath and Lamb (1979) reveals that both LTA and Ekman transport (ME) are found to be high during the summer monsoon. The LTAs are caused by different oceanographic processes; off the southwest coast of India, the positive LTAs are due to upwelling that is driven by the summer monsoonal winds. Along the northern part of the east coast of India the negative LTAs are attributed to the discharges of river water, which also depends on the strength of summer monsoon. Earlier studies on the planktonic foraminifera in the northern Indian Ocean documented that the Globigerinoides bulloides and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei are reliable indicators of upwelling and sea surface salinity, respectively. The existing significant relationships between LTAs and ME during summer monsoon in both the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal suggest that the variation in abundance of Globigerina bulloides and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei in the sediment cores of Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal can trace the intensity of paleoupwelling and river discharge and thereby associated summer monsoon intensity and productivity changes in the northern Indian Ocean.},

	abstract = {Changes in the amplitude and phasing of seasonal events (phenology) can affect the functioning of marine ecosystems. Phenology plays a particularly critical role in eastern boundary ecosystems, which are driven largely by the seasonal cycle of coastal upwelling. Here we develop and describe a set of indicators that quantify the timing, evolution, intensity, and duration of coastal upwelling in the California Current large marine ecosystem (CCLME). There is significant interannual variability in upwelling characteristics during 1967–2007, with extended periods of high (1970s, 1998–2004) and low (1980–1995) seasonally-integrated upwelling and a trend towards a later and shorter upwelling season in the northern CCLME. El Niño years were characterized by delayed and weak upwelling in the central CCLME. Understanding the causes and ecosystem consequences of phenological changes in coastal upwelling is critical, as climate models project significant variability in the amplitude and phase of coastal upwelling under varying climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {A statistical analysis of Baltic Sea upwelling has been carried out to cover, for the first time, the entire sea area for the period 1990–2009. Weekly composite SST maps based on NOAA/AVHRR satellite data were used to evaluate the location and frequency of upwelling. The results obtained were analysed and compared with earlier studies with excellent agreement. Our study enables the most intense upwelling areas in the entire Baltic Sea to be evaluated. According to the analysis of 443 SST maps, the most common upwelling regions are found off the Swedish south and east coasts (frequency 10–25\%), the Swedish coast of the Bothnian Bay (16\%), the southern tip of Gotland (up to 15\%), and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Finland (up to 15\%). Pronounced upwelling also occurs off the Estonian coast and the Baltic east coast (up to 15\%), the Polish coast and the west coast of Rügen (10–15\%); otherwise the upwelling frequency was between 5 and 10\%. Additionally, simulated SST distributions derived from a Baltic Sea numerical model were analysed for the same period. Furthermore, at specific positions close to the coastline, surface winds based on the SMHI meteorological data base were analysed for the same 20-year period. Wind components parallel to the coast were discriminated into favourable and unfavourable winds forcing upwelling. The obtained frequencies of upwelling-favourable winds fit very well the observed upwelling frequencies derived from satellite SST maps. A positive trend of upwelling frequencies along the Swedish east coast and the Finnish coast of the Gulf of Finland was calculated for the period 1990–2009.},

	abstract = {Satellite data (AVHRR) and in situ data of sea-surface temperatures have been used to describe wind-induced upwelling along the Swedish coast of the Baltic. The satellite data, transformed to isotherm charts, points out three sections of the coast where the upwelling is especially intense. The cold upwelled water, normally found within 10–20 km from the coast, sometimes spreads out in finger-like filaments. There are indications of propagation of upwelling fronts and centers, which may be associated with coastal-trapped waves. Ten years of in situ measurements of sea-surface temperature have been used for a statistical compilation of upwelling events. The statistics reveal that upwelling is a common feature along certain sections of the coast, occurring for about one-fourth to one-third of the time. Some information of time scales and temperature anomalies associated with the upwelling events are also given. A wind analysis shows a correlation between upwelling and winds parallel to the shore line, in accordance with the Ekman theory of upwelling generation.},

	abstract = {Coastal upwelling ecosystems are among the most productive ecosystems in the world, meaning that their response to climate change is of critical importance. Our understanding of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems is largely limited to the open ocean, mainly because coastal upwelling is poorly reproduced by current earth system models. Here, a high-resolution model is used to examine the response of nutrients and plankton dynamics to future climate change in the California Current System (CCS). The results show increased upwelling intensity associated with stronger alongshore winds in the coastal region, and enhanced upper-ocean stratification in both the CCS and open ocean. Warming of the open ocean forces isotherms downwards, where they make contact with water masses with higher nutrient concentrations, thereby enhancing the nutrient flux to the deep source waters of the CCS. Increased winds and eddy activity further facilitate upward nutrient transport to the euphotic zone. However, the plankton community exhibits a complex and nonlinear response to increased nutrient input, as the food web dynamics tend to interact differently. This analysis highlights the difficulty in understanding how the marine ecosystem responds to a future warming climate, given to range of relevant processes operating at different scales.},

	abstract = {Ocean processes are generally large scale on the U.S. Pacific Northwest coast; this is true of both seasonal variations and event-scale upwelling-downwelling fluctuations., which are highly energetic. Coastal upwelling supplies most of the macronutrients available for production, although the intensity of upwelling-favorable wind forcing increases southward while primary production and chlorophyll are higher in the north, off the Washington coast. This discrepancy could be related to several mesoscale features: the wider, more gently sloping shelf to the north, the existence of numerous submarine canyons to the north, the availability of Columbia River plume water and sediment north of the river mouth, and the existence of a semi-permanent eddy offshore of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. We suggest that these features have important effects on the magnitude and timing of macronutrient or micronutrient delivery to the plankton. These features are potentially important as well to transport pathways and residence times of planktonic larvae and to the development of harmful algal blooms. The coastal plain estuaries, with the exception of the Columbia River, are relatively small, with large tidal forcing and highly seasonal direct river inputs that are low to negligible during the growing season. Primary production in these estuaries is likely controlled not by river-driven stratification but by coastal upwelling and exchange with the ocean. Both baroclinic mechanisms (the gravitational circulation) and barotropic ones (lateral stirring by tide and, possibly, wind) contribute to this exchange. Because estuarine hydrography and ecology are so dominated by ocean signals, the coastal estuaries, like the coastal ocean, are largely synchronous on seasonal and event time scales, though, intrusions of the Columbia River plume can cause strong asymmetries between Washington and Oregon estuaries especially during spring downwelling conditions. Water property correlation increases between spring and summer as wind forcing becomes more spatially coherent along the coast. Estuarine habitat is structure not only, by large scale forcing but also by fine scale processes in the extensive intertidal zone, such as by solar heating or differential advection by tidal, curents.},
