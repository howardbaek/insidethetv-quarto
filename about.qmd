![](about-me.JPG){height="500px"}

I am a Software Development Engineer at the [Fred Hutch Data Science Lab](https://hutchdatascience.org/).

I have a Master's in Biostatistics from the University of Washington. My past experiences include an internship at [Merck](https://github.com/Merck), a [Machine Learning Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/Upwelling-Image-Analysis) at Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), where I created an algorithm to detect an oceanographic process, [NIH Research Assistantship](https://github.com/howardbaek/addiction-dashboard-simple) at the Behavioral Research In Technology and Engineering (BRiTE) Center, where I developed a Shiny Dashboard that allows patients and clinicians in addiction treatment to monitor patients' progress and goals over time, and an [Educational Data Mining Research Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/mooc-project-github) at George Mason University, where I analyzed real world datasets of an online course at Stanford.
