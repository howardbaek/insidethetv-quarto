![](about-me.JPG){height=500px}

I am a Master’s student in Biostatistics (Data Science Pathway) at the University of Washington. Also, I am a Contractor at Merck, where I design internal R packages and a Shiny app for analysis and reporting process in a regulatory environment. Recently, I worked as a Biostatistics Intern at Merck, where I created an R package for querying ClinicalTrials.gov and building an analysis dataset (focus on oncology clinical trials) and programmed an accompanying Shiny app.

My past experiences include a [Machine Learning Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/Upwelling-Image-Analysis) at Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), where I created an algorithm to detect an oceanographic process, [NIH Research Assistantship](https://github.com/howardbaek/addiction-dashboard-simple) at the Behavioral Research In Technology and Engineering (BRiTE) Center, where I developed a Shiny Dashboard that allows patients and clinicians in addiction treatment to monitor patients’ progress and goals over time, and an [Educational Data Mining Research Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/mooc-project-github) at George Mason University, where I analyzed real world datasets of an online course at Stanford.
